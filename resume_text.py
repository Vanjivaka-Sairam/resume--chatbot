## PROJECTS

### E-commerce Website with Admin Dashboard using MERN Stack  
*Full-Stack Web Application*  
- Developed a full-featured e-commerce web application leveraging the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).  
- Implemented essential functionalities such as user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, order processing, and secure checkout.  
- Designed and integrated an intuitive admin dashboard for managing products, users, and orders efficiently.  
- Built a dynamic and responsive frontend using React.js, ensuring seamless user experience across devices.  
- Utilized MongoDB for scalable data management, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of user, product, and transaction data.  

**Simple Product Store**  
*Full-Stack Web Application*  
- Developed a modern, full-stack product store application using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).  
- Designed an intuitive and responsive user interface with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI for an enhanced user experience.  
- Implemented Arcjet-based bot detection and rate limiting to improve security and prevent automated threats.  
- Utilized Zustand for efficient global state management, ensuring seamless data flow across the application.  

**Digital Image Encryption using AES and RSA Cryptographic Algorithms**  
*Group Project*  
- Designed and implemented a secure image encryption system by integrating symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) cryptographic algorithms to ensure both speed and security.  
- Employed the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for high-performance encryption of large-scale digital images.  
- Applied Rivest-Shamirâ€“Adleman (RSA) encryption to protect AES keys, ensuring secure key distribution and enhanced resistance to interception.  
- Utilized the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for image preprocessing, segmenting images into 128-bit blocks to align with AES encryption requirements.  

**Effective Path Finding using A* Algorithm**  
*Data Structures (CS201)*  
- Designed and implemented an A* (A-star) algorithm in C to determine the most efficient and least-hop paths between cities in a road network modeled as a matrix.  
- Constructed a custom city map using Maps API to simulate realistic geographical data and enhance user interaction.  
- Utilized the Haversine formula to compute straight-line (heuristic) distances between cities based on their geographic coordinates.
